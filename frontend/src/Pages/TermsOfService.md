**Nostalgia-fy Terms of Service**

*Last Updated: Probably Never*

Welcome to Nostalgia-fy, the world's premier (and possibly only) online store dedicated to reliving your childhood by buying back all the toys, gadgets, and questionable fashion choices you ditched years ago! Before you dive into our treasure trove of nostalgia, we have some terms you should definitely read (or just pretend to read like everyone else does). By checking that box, you're agreeing to the following:

### 1. **The "I Swear I Won’t Hoard" Clause**
By agreeing to these terms, you solemnly promise not to turn your house into a cluttered museum of forgotten eras. We’re not responsible if you suddenly need to rent a storage unit because you just *had* to buy 17 Furbies.

### 2. **No Time Machines Allowed**
We get it—you want to go back to the 90s. But please, don't use our site as a makeshift time machine. If you do happen to accidentally travel back in time, just remember: no refunds for items bought in the past!

### 3. **The "Why Did I Buy This?" Guarantee**
All sales are final. If you wake up at 3 AM, clutching a Tamagotchi and asking yourself, "Why did I buy this?"—well, that’s on you. Remember, nostalgia is a powerful (and sometimes irrational) force.

### 4. **No Judging Policy**
If you choose to spend $200 on a mint-condition POG set or a life-sized replica of your favorite Saturday morning cartoon character, that's your business. We promise not to judge... much.

### 5. **The "I Won’t Sue" Pact**
By using our site, you agree not to sue us if your spouse/partner/roommate/friend looks at your purchase history and demands an explanation. We suggest practicing your "it was on sale" speech.

By checking that box, you agree to all the wacky, weird, and wonderful terms above. Now go forth and relive your childhood, one questionable purchase at a time!
