## Project Overview

Nostalgiafy is an e-commerce platform designed to mimic the functionality of Shopify, but with a unique focus on items that remind users of their childhood. Whether it's toys, games, or vintage collectibles, Nostalgiafy offers a curated selection of nostalgic products that transport users back in time.

This project was developed as a part of a school assignment to explore full-stack development, user authentication, and database management.
